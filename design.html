                <h1>Design</h1>

                <p class="lead">This project used python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</p>

                <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/erinbspace/exoplanet_project">code on github</a> to see exactly how everything works!</p>

                <h4>Gathering the Data</h4>

                <p>For the first step, I forked the git repository containing the exoplanet data from the <a href="https://github.com/hannorein/open_exoplanet_catalogue">open exoplanet catalog on github.</a> This contained the database in a series of individual XML documents. I used python to concatinate all of the seperate xml files in the database into one long xml file called systems.xml. That way, if I'd like to update it in the future, I can simply pull from the exoplanet catalog github repository and re-create the master systems xml file to be used for plotting.</p>

                <h4>Making sense of it all</h4>

                <p>To start parsing my new xml file, I used tools built in to d3.js that read from the file and stored them in an object that could then later be referenced in other calls to d3 graphing functions. I only decided to add the planet to my database if it had most of the parameters I wanted to deal with: name, mass, radius, semimajoraxis, and period. If the planet had all of that but no description, I simply added a generic one.</p>

                <p>I decided to have all of the javascript in the index.html file because I wanted to easily pass variables back and forth between the HTML forms at the bottom and the graphing calls to d3. When I tried to create a seperate .js file for all of the javascript, I had trouble connecting the html form inputs and the javascript calls to d3 to render the graphs. In lieu of that, I tried to keep everything nicely organized within the javascript on the html page.</p>


                <h4>Wishlist</h4>

                <p>While I worked for quite a long time on this project, I simply didn't have time to finsih everything I wanted to finish! Here are a few things that I'll most likely fix in the near future</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More data from the database to make more choices for displaying the graph</li>
                    <li>An option to export your graph as an image file</li>
                    <li>More color choices. I tried to make discovery method a color choice option, but that did not work very well. To do this I need to fix the color legend.</li>
                    <li>Transitions between chart options. I am just now starting to get the hang of d3, and tried very hard to add pretty transitions between different data representations. I just couldn't do it in time. Soon.</li>
                    <li>The planet graphic sometimes gets in the way of the text, because I couldn't figure out how to position it better. What started out as a silly idea progressed into a feature that took waaaay too much time for its own good. I'd like to make it better (and maybe add a planet, or in the distant future make that interactive, too!</p>
                </ul>



                <p>
                    One thing that's clear is that I had a lot of help from various forums, tutorials, and friends along the way. Here's a list of the tutorials and advice I followed to get everything working.
